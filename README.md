# Better World Quests

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at one of the following sites:

- [WoWInterface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24797)

## Description

This addon replaces the world quest map pins, following the default style but shows the rewards at a quick glance.
It also shows the world quest pins on parent maps, e.g. all Broken Isles sub-zone world quests on the Broken Isles map.
It also lets you alter the their size through options (`/bwq`), and temporarily hide them while holding down `ALT`.

Due to the nature of this addon, any other addons that deals with world quests on the map are probably incompatible, and support for them will not happen.
